# Usefull scripts

We need to download the  `mavinit.scr` script, that contains some aliases, very useful when doing motors tests.For downloading it, do the following:

```
wget http://tridge.github.io/MAVProxy/files/mavinit.scr
```

It is very recommendable to store it in the directory where you will launch Mavproxy, for not need to add a route.

Lastly, with the `less mavinit.scr` command, you can see the different aliases for the graphs.
