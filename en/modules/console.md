# Console

A GUI console that displays important information to the UAV's current state. The area below the menu bar shows on the upper row (left to right): Flight mode, GPS status, System voltage, Telemetry radio link quality, Inertial system availability, magnetometer availability, airspeed sensor availability and geofence status. The second row shows further details of the telemetry link quality. The third and fourth rows show selected sensor readings.

The menu bar allows the user to change any of the global MAVProxy settings, as well as shortcuts to command waypoint, rally point and geofence commands.
