#Erle Gitbook: MAV Tools

[![Build Status](https://www.gitbook.io/button/status/book/erlerobotics/erle-robotics-mav-tools)](https://www.gitbook.io/book/erlerobotics/erle-robotics-mav-tools/activity)

##Book

In this GitBook we analyze the different tools used with Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) most commonly known as drones. We show how to make graphics, analyze data and overall we teach you how improve your flight experience. **In this book it explained how to understand log files using MAVProxy tools**. All the log in this book come from [Erle board](http://erlerobot.com/). **Erle** is **a small-size Linux computer for making drones.**

##About

For years we've been working in the robotics field, particularly with drones. We have passed through different Universities and research centers and in all these places we actually found that most of the **drones are black boxes** (check out our [60s pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKAqjyXaC18)). Not meant to be used for learning, research. The software they use is in most of the cases unknown, closed source or **not documented**. Given these conditions, how are we going to educate the next generations on this technologies? How do you get started programming drones if you don't have $1000+ budget? Which platform allows me to get started with drones without risking a hand?

We are coming up with an answer to all these questions, our technology: **Erle**.

Inspired by the BeagleBone development board, we have designed a small computer with about 36+ sensors, plenty of I/O and processing power for real-time analysis. Erle is the enabling technology for the next generation of aerial and terrestrial robots that will be used in cities solving tasks such as surveillance, enviromental monitoring or even providing aid at catastrophes.

Our small-size Linux computer is bringing robotics to the people and businesses.
